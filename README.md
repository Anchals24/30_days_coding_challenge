# HELLLOOO CODERS!!!!! :D
I love to solve problems and in order to serve the community back, I've decided to come up with this 30-days-coding-challenge. 

AIM: 

- To help the students preparing for interview(Python coders specifically since I faced a lot of difficulties in finding content on Python).
- Helping others as much as I can since a lot of people helped me in understanding Data structures & Algorithms. It's PAYBACK TIME!!! :D
- Andd to make my days even more productive :P

Also, I do understand that I might be sharing the content which most of the people might be knowing already or which is already there on the Internet. But, then Why I am doing this? :( 

- Because I personally believe that if a few(even a single student) comes across my post and he/she might be getting to learn something new, or getting motivated to re-start again, or maybe their concepts are getting revised. I will be more than happy! :D
[Motive is to JUST HELP THE UPCOMING CODERS or THE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THIS DOMAIN/LOOKING FOR A CHANGE or MAYBE THE EXISTING ONES ;)]

So, GET READYYYYYYYYY!! :) 

Let's code ruthlessly :D
